# Importance sampling for partially observed temporal epidemic models

This contains code to support the paper:

Black, A. J. (2018) Importance sampling for partially observed temporal epidemic models.


The first parts are coded in MATLAB and illustrate the basic importance sampling technique for a number of increasingly complex epidemic models. The second part is a particle marginal Metropolis Hastings algorithm for implementing Bayesian inference using the importance sampling. This is coded in C.

1. Upload ~~SEIR~~, ~~SEEIIRp~~, ~~SEIAR~~.
2. Upload Particle filter code.
